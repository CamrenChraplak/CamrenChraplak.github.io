							<h1>Musical Robot Arm</h1>
							<h2>(10/2024 to 12/2024)</h2>
							<p>
								&emsp;"The Arm” is a five degree of freedom (DOF) robot arm that is able to play a small MIDI keyboard and various percussion instruments, such as
								a drum and a cymbal. It is capable of playing up to two notes simultaneously on the keyboard with its linear gripper, and it plays the drum with a
								wooden drumstick mounted flexibly on its end-effector. It parses input in MIDI format, and is capable of playing one instrument at a time. “The Arm”
								is able to play quarter notes at a maximum of 120 BPM, though its piano playing accuracy does decrease with play rate. To achieve proper timing, the
								MIDI file is pre-processed before playing into a joint-space trajectory which ensures that the end-effector intersects the desires positions at
								precisely the note-on times read from the MIDI input."
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								My contributions to the project include
								<ul>
									<li>designing and implimenting the piano and drum end effector for the arm</li>
									<li>
										designing and implimenting the standalone string instrument to play<br>
										<p class="bullet-note">stepper motor driver got fried the day before resulting in it not being functional</p>
									</li>
									<li>coding the system to control the string instrument</li>

							<h1>Open Source Desktop CNC Mill Senior Project</h1>
							<h2>(8/2024 to Present)</h2>
							<p>
								&emsp;Me and my team are expanding on a previous team's design for a desktop CNC mill. For improving current systems, we will construct a more robust
								outer frame, design a better coolant sealing/draining, have more user friendly software, and improve the safety of the machine. In addition, we will
								integrate new features such as auto bed leveling, a 4th axis, tool changer, and integrated computer interface. Our base model mill will cost under
								$2,500 with optional addons that allow the user to upgrade their machine. This system will be easy to manufacture, fit in a 2ft by 2ft by 3ft, and
								be open source for hobbyists to recreate.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								My overall goals for this project is to improve the current machine by
								<ul>
									<li>selecting a more user friendly software.</li>
									<li>selecting a control board compatible with the new software.</li>
									<li>implimenting tool changing, auto bed leveling, and machine monitoring through software.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The status of my goals for the project include
								<ul>
									<li>choosing Universal GCode Sender as the user interface.</li>
									<li>selecting PicoCNC for driving the mainboard logic using grblHAL.</li>
									<li>implimenting monitoring through accelerometers and temperature sensors.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The goals that are still a work in progress include 
								<ul>
									<li>fully implimenting machine monitoring through strain gauges, a tachometer, and camera logging.</li>
									<li>creating plugins for controlling an automatic tool changer and auto bed leveling at the hardware and user interface level.</li>
								</ul>

							<h1>Arduino Car Interface</h1>
							<h2>(5/2024 to Present)</h2>
							<p>
								&emsp;This is a personal project I created to add additional features to my current vehicle. Currently, it doesn't have any headphone input for playing music and doesn't have a functioning speedometer.
								This project aims to fix this by adding connections for connecting a headphone jack, adding play/pause/forward/reverse button controls, and adding a digital spedometer.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								My overall goals for this project is to improve my car by
								<ul>
									<li>having built in support for headphone jack and audio controls.</li>
									<li>having built in support for a digital speedometer.</li>
									<li>encasing and connecting modules with the car.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The status of my goals for the project include
								<ul>
									<li>developing and fabricating PCBs.</li>
									<li>creating fully functional code for the project.</li>
									<li>testing speedometer PCB functionality.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The goals that are still a work in progress include 
								<ul>
									<li>testing the audio PCB.</li>
									<li>creating 3D prints for housing the modules.</li>
									<li>connecting it to my vehicle.</li>
								</ul>

							<h1>Software Engineering Hospital Kiosk</h1>
							<h2>(1/2024 to 3/2024)</h2>
							<p>
								&emsp;The goal of this project was to develop a kiosk application for Brigham and Women's Hospital. Several kiosks will be laid
								out across the hospital providing assistance to hospital patients, visitors, and employees. The application helps users find
								rooms and other points of interest in the hospital through an interactive map. Additionally, the application allows users to
								submit service requests for patient transportation, gift or medicine delivery, maintenance, and more. These services can be
								requested from any kiosk and carried out to any hospital location as required. The application also features admin controls to
								allow hospital personnel to edit the interactive map, import or export data from the database, view service requests and employee
								data, and more. The project sought out to create an application that was easy to use and intuitive in a kiosk setting. The hope is
								that the application will aid in customer service and improve customer satisfaction as well as aid hospital personnel in providing
								exceptional care for their patients.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								My contributions to the project include
								<ul>
									<li>designing map interface. This includes navigation buttons, touch screen interface, resizing actions, node details, and floor changes.</li>
									<li>keeping 11 person team on track with project goals and leading user stories as product owner.</li>

							<h1>Microcontroller Oscilloscope</h1>
							<h2>(6/2023 to Present)</h2>
							<p>
								&emsp;Oscilloscopes in the modern age can cost hundreds of dollars for a basic model while it is often a necessity for any complex electronics project.
								To solve this, many tinkerers have developed their own oscilloscopes, with many posted online. However, most solutions involve multiple and specialized components,
								while lacking many functions of normal oscilloscopes. The goal of the project is to provide access to an oscilloscope, with the only necessary hardware
								being a micro-controller and a phone/computer, along with providing the functionality of most common oscilloscopes.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								My overall goals for this project is to create an accessible oscilloscope by
								<ul>
									<li>having makers use microcontrollers they have on hand at a cheap price.</li>
									<li>providing Wifi, Bluetooth, and Serial connections for various circumstances.</li>
									<li>include addons for extra features (ie. external ADC's, AC voltage, etc.).</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The status of my goals for the project include
								<ul>
									<li>protoyping preliminary web interface.</li>
									<li>protoyping preliminary code for ESP32.</li>
									<li>template for collecting and sending data to web page.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The goals that are still a work in progress include 
								<ul>
									<li>fully implimenting a web interface for ESP32.</li>
									<li>creating a HAL for use by mutliple microcontrollers.</li>
									<li>creating apps for use by Bluetooth and Serial on PC.</li>
								</ul>
