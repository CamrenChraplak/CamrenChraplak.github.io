		<h1>Arduino Car Interface</h1>
		<h2>(5/2024 to Present)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;This is a personal project I created to add additional features to my current vehicle. Currently, it doesn't have any headphone input for playing music and doesn't have a functioning speedometer.
			This project aims to fix this by adding connections for connecting a headphone jack, adding play/pause/forward/reverse button controls, and adding a digital spedometer.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			My overall goals for this project is to improve my car by
			<ul>
				<li>having built in support for headphone jack and audio controls.</li>
				<li>having built in support for a digital speedometer.</li>
				<li>encasing and connecting modules with the car.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The status of my goals for the project include
			<ul>
				<li>developing and fabricating PCBs.</li>
				<li>creating fully functional code for the project.</li>
				<li>testing speedometer PCB functionality.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The goals that are still a work in progress include 
			<ul>
				<li>testing the audio PCB.</li>
				<li>creating 3D prints for housing the modules.</li>
				<li>connecting it to my vehicle.</li>
			</ul>
