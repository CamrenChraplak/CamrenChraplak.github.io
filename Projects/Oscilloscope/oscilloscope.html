		<h1>Microcontroller Oscilloscope</h1>
		<h2>(6/2025 to Present)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;Oscilloscopes in the modern age can cost hundreds of dollars for a basic model while it is often a necessity for any complex electronics project.
			To solve this, many tinkerers have developed their own oscilloscopes, with many posted online.
			However, most solutions have low data collection rates, lack common oscilloscope features, and require specialized hardware.
			The goal of the project is to provide open source access to an oscilloscope, with the only necessary hardware
			being a micro-controller and a phone/computer, along with providing the functionality of most common oscilloscopes.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			My overall goals for this project is to create an accessible oscilloscope by
			<ul>
				<li>enabling makers to use microcontrollers they have on hand at a cheap price.</li>
				<li>providing WiFi, Bluetooth, and Serial connections for various communication methods.</li>
				<li>including addons for extra features (ie. external ADC's, AC voltage, logic analyzer, function generator, etc.).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The status of my goals for the project include
			<ul>
				<li>developing code that is board independent using PlatformIO.</li>
				<li>configurable code that allows custom user functionality for essential features.</li>
				<li>implimenting unit tests for common board functionality.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The goals that are still a work in progress include 
			<ul>
				<li>finishing base oscilloscope functionality for reading and sending voltages.</li>
				<li>implementing board optimized configurations for faster data collection rates.</li>
				<li>developing communication apps between the microcontrollers and monitoring devices (laptops, phones, etc.).</li>
			</ul>
