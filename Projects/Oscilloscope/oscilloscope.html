		<h1>Microcontroller Oscilloscope</h1>
		<h2>(6/2023 to Present)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;Oscilloscopes in the modern age can cost hundreds of dollars for a basic model while it is often a necessity for any complex electronics project.
			To solve this, many tinkerers have developed their own oscilloscopes, with many posted online. However, most solutions involve multiple and specialized components,
			while lacking many functions of normal oscilloscopes. The goal of the project is to provide access to an oscilloscope, with the only necessary hardware
			being a micro-controller and a phone/computer, along with providing the functionality of most common oscilloscopes.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			My overall goals for this project is to create an accessible oscilloscope by
			<ul>
				<li>having makers use microcontrollers they have on hand at a cheap price.</li>
				<li>providing Wifi, Bluetooth, and Serial connections for various circumstances.</li>
				<li>include addons for extra features (ie. external ADC's, AC voltage, etc.).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The status of my goals for the project include
			<ul>
				<li>protoyping preliminary web interface.</li>
				<li>protoyping preliminary code for ESP32.</li>
				<li>template for collecting and sending data to web page.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The goals that are still a work in progress include 
			<ul>
				<li>fully implimenting a web interface for ESP32.</li>
				<li>creating a HAL for use by mutliple microcontrollers.</li>
				<li>creating apps for use by Bluetooth and Serial on PC.</li>
			</ul>
