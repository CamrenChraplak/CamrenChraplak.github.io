		<h1>Musical Robot Arm</h1>
		<h2>(10/2024 to 12/2024)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;"The Arm” is a five degree of freedom (DOF) robot arm that is able to play a small MIDI keyboard and various percussion instruments, such as
			a drum and a cymbal. It is capable of playing up to two notes simultaneously on the keyboard with its linear gripper, and it plays the drum with a
			wooden drumstick mounted flexibly on its end-effector. It parses input in MIDI format, and is capable of playing one instrument at a time. “The Arm”
			is able to play quarter notes at a maximum of 120 BPM, though its piano playing accuracy does decrease with play rate. To achieve proper timing, the
			MIDI file is pre-processed before playing into a joint-space trajectory which ensures that the end-effector intersects the desires positions at
			precisely the note-on times read from the MIDI input."

			My contributions to the project include
			<ul>
				<li>designing and implimenting the piano and drum end effector for the arm</li>
				<li>
					designing and implimenting the standalone string instrument to play<br>
					<p class="bullet-note">stepper motor driver got fried the day before resulting in it not being functional</p>
				</li>
				<li>coding the system to control the string instrument</li>
			</ul>
