		<h1>Software Engineering Hospital Kiosk</h1>
		<h2>(1/2024 to 3/2024)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;The goal of this project was to develop a kiosk application for Brigham and Women's Hospital. Several kiosks will be laid
			out across the hospital providing assistance to hospital patients, visitors, and employees. The application helps users find
			rooms and other points of interest in the hospital through an interactive map. Additionally, the application allows users to
			submit service requests for patient transportation, gift or medicine delivery, maintenance, and more. These services can be
			requested from any kiosk and carried out to any hospital location as required. The application also features admin controls to
			allow hospital personnel to edit the interactive map, import or export data from the database, view service requests and employee
			data, and more. The project sought out to create an application that was easy to use and intuitive in a kiosk setting. The hope is
			that the application will aid in customer service and improve customer satisfaction as well as aid hospital personnel in providing
			exceptional care for their patients.
