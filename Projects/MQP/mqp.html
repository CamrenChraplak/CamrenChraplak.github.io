		<h1>Open Source Desktop CNC Mill Senior Project</h1>
		<h2>(8/2024 to 5/2025)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;This project explores the development of an open-source desktop
			Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling machine, including the integration
			of an improved control architecture and sensor suite, with the intention
			being to address the lack of accessible desktop-machining options for
			students and hobbyists. Industrial CNC machines cost over $30,000, and
			these machines' individualized software creates obstacles for their users.
			The base-model machine, priced at $2,800, provides users with an intuitive
			graphical interface for controlling the machine and the additional functionality;
			the design also gives users the ability to manufacture the machine with minimal
			outsourcing. The modular base-model supports a coolant system, automatic tool
			changer, 4th-axis, and mechanical bed leveling. User friendly and open-source
			software were used and customized to expand the capabilities of the previous three
			axis system. The machine additionally included many electrical safety systems for
			regular use in classroom settings. Furthermore, various sensors were utilized
			during the development, producing data that validated the effectiveness of all
			its functionalities. The machine produced repeatability within 0.005”, acceleration
			within ±0.03 g, safe motor temperatures. The final result was an affordable CNC
			mill that allows users to become familiarized with the basics of machining in
			a safe environment.

		<p>
			My overall goals for this project were to improve the existing machine by
			<ul>
				<li>selecting a more user friendly software.</li>
				<li>selecting a control board compatible with the new software.</li>
				<li>implimenting tool changing, safety systems, and machine monitoring through software.</li>
			</ul>
