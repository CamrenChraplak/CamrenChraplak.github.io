		<h1>Open Source Desktop CNC Mill Senior Project</h1>
		<h2>(8/2024 to Present)</h2>
		<p>
			&emsp;Me and my team are expanding on a previous team's design for a desktop CNC mill. For improving current systems, we will construct a more robust
			outer frame, design a better coolant sealing/draining, have more user friendly software, and improve the safety of the machine. In addition, we will
			integrate new features such as auto bed leveling, a 4th axis, tool changer, and integrated computer interface. Our base model mill will cost under
			$2,500 with optional addons that allow the user to upgrade their machine. This system will be easy to manufacture, fit in a 2ft by 2ft by 3ft, and
			be open source for hobbyists to recreate.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			My overall goals for this project is to improve the current machine by
			<ul>
				<li>selecting a more user friendly software.</li>
				<li>selecting a control board compatible with the new software.</li>
				<li>implimenting tool changing, auto bed leveling, and machine monitoring through software.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The status of my goals for the project include
			<ul>
				<li>choosing Universal GCode Sender as the user interface.</li>
				<li>selecting PicoCNC for driving the mainboard logic using grblHAL.</li>
				<li>implimenting monitoring through accelerometers and temperature sensors.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The goals that are still a work in progress include 
			<ul>
				<li>fully implimenting machine monitoring through strain gauges, a tachometer, and camera logging.</li>
				<li>creating plugins for controlling an automatic tool changer and auto bed leveling at the hardware and user interface level.</li>
			</ul>
